# Getting your Dev Box Set up

Hello and welcome to this walkthrough on getting your dev box set up.  This walkthrough will walk you through the steps to get your Windows machine for modern cloud application development.  This will include installing the following:

- Visual Studio Code
- Windows Terminal
- GIT
- SQL Server Developer Edition
- SQL Server Management Studio
- Visual Studio Community
- Java 21
- Chocolatey
- NodeJS
- NPM
- Yarn
- Angular
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)
- Ubuntu
- Docker
- Azure CLI

## Prerequisites

This walkthrough assumes you have a Windows machine.  It also assumes you have administrative rights on your machine.  If you do not have administrative rights on your machine, you will not be able to complete this walkthrough.

## Getting Started  

You can mostly complete these modules in any order, however I would recommend doing the first 5 modules in order.  If you are following the walkthrough, you must do module 4 before you can complete module 5.

A few of these walkthroughs are completely optional.  You may only need some of them.  If you don't need a module, then skip it and move on.
