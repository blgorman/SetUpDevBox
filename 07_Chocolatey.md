# Install Chocolatey

In this task you'll get Chocolatey installed on your machine.

`Chocolatey` is used to do package installations on Windows machines.  It is similar to `apt-get` on Linux or `brew` on Mac.

## Task 1 - Install via PowerShell

## Task 2 - Validate Installation


You now have Chocolatey installed on your machine. You can use it going forward to install common packages on your machine.  

>**Note:** Chocolately is incredibly useful for getting docker to work on a Windows box when you can't use Docker Desktop.  You can use it to install `docker` on your machine to work with WSL.  This will happen in a later walkthrough.
