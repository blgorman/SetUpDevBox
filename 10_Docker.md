In this task you'll get Docker installed on your machine.

>**Note:** If you are not working for a large organization you can use Docker Desktop.  If you are working for a large organization, you should avoid using Docker Desktop unless your organization is paying for licensing.  

Because of licensing issues, this tutorial will utilize Docker directly within WSL without Docker Desktop.

If you can use Docker Desktop, you should just install the solution from their website and docker will then be working for your from that point on in both WSL and Windows.
