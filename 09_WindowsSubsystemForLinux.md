# Get the Windows Subsystem for Linux and Ubuntu installed on your machine

You can now run a side-by-side distribution of Linux on your Windows machine.  This is a great way to get access to Linux tools and utilities without having to run a VM.

This is especially useful for doing containerized (modern/cloud-native) development on your machine.
