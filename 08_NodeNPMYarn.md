# Node, NPM, and YARN

If you are going to be developing with Angular or React or any other Javascript framework, you'll need to have Node and NPM installed on your machine.  YARN is also a tool that has historically performed better than NPM to get packages (although this may no longer be the case).  I would still recommend installing YARN until I hear reasons not to.
