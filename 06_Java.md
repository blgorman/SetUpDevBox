# Install Java and validate that it is working

In this walkthrough you'll get Java installed on your machine and validate that it is working.

>**Note:** This is optional and should only be done if you are going to be developing in Java on your machine.  If you are only doing .NET development, you should skip this step.

## Task 1 - Install Java

To get Java installed on your machine, you'll need to download the latest SDK and install it.

1. Download Java
1. Install Java
1. Add Java environment variables to PATH
1. Validate `javac` and `java` commands run from the command line

## Task 2 - Validate Java is installed

Once you have Java installed and working, create a simple program in VSCode to validate that it is working.

1. Get VSCode Java extensions
1. Create a simple Java program
1. Run the program
1. Validate the output

## Conclusion

At this point you should have Java working on your machine.  If you are going to be doing production-level Java development, you should also install Eclipse, Netbeans, or IntelliJ.  For academic Java development, VSCode should be sufficient.  Additionally, if you need more help, look into a simple Java IDE like BlueJ.
